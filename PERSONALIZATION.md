# üé® Personalization Guide

How to customize your Home Assistant AI context for the best results.

## Overview of the 4-File System

Your AI context consists of 4 customizable files that work together:

1. **Boot Instructions** - How the AI should interact with you
2. **Persona** - The AI's personality and character
3. **HA Export** - Your actual Home Assistant configuration (auto-generated)
4. **Personal Info** - Your household details and preferences

## üìù Customizing Boot Instructions

**File:** `context/1_boot_instructions.md`

This file controls HOW the AI responds to you. Key sections to customize:

### Response Format Preferences
```markdown
- **Code blocks**: [Complete YAML / Just the changes / With explanations]
- **Entity IDs**: [Always use mine / Show alternatives / Explain choices]
- **Explanations**: [Minimal / Detailed / Only for complex logic]
```

### Communication Style
Adjust based on your experience level:
- **Beginner**: "Explain everything, assume I'm new to HA"
- **Intermediate**: "Skip basics, explain complex parts"
- **Expert**: "Just give me the code with minimal explanation"

### Task Handling
Define your workflow preferences:
- Do you want multiple solution options?
- Should the AI suggest related automations?
- How much validation and error checking?

## ü§ñ Customizing Your AI Persona

**File:** `context/2_persona.md`

Give your AI assistant a personality that works for you:

### Personality Styles

**The Professional**
```markdown
**Name**: Assistant
**Role**: Technical consultant
**Traits**: Precise, efficient, formal
```

**The Friendly Helper**
```markdown
**Name**: Homey
**Role**: Your smart home buddy
**Traits**: Enthusiastic, patient, encouraging
```

**The Expert**
```markdown
**Name**: HAL 9000
**Role**: Automation architect
**Traits**: Sophisticated, innovative, thorough
```

### Customization Tips
- Choose a name that makes interactions feel natural
- Define how technical or casual you want responses
- Set boundaries (what the AI shouldn't do)

## üè† Personal Information

**File:** `context/4_personal_info.md`

Generated by the interview script, but you should review and enhance:

### Essential Details
- **Accurate schedules**: The AI uses these for time-based automations
- **Household members**: Helps tailor complexity and safety features
- **Pet information**: Important for climate and security automations

### Goals and Pain Points
Be specific about:
- What frustrates you about your current setup
- What you're trying to achieve
- Your technical comfort level

### Privacy Considerations
- Only include information you're comfortable sharing
- Use general descriptions if preferred (e.g., "school-age children" vs exact ages)
- This file stays local - never committed to git

## üîß Advanced Customization

### Creating Multiple Profiles

You can maintain different profiles for different purposes:

```bash
# Work-focused profile
cp -r context/ context_work/

# Family-friendly profile  
cp -r context/ context_family/

# Testing profile
cp -r context/ context_test/
```

### Conditional Preferences

Add situational preferences to your boot instructions:

```markdown
## Context-Specific Rules
- For security automations: Always include multiple verification steps
- For lighting: Prefer scenes over individual device control
- For climate: Energy efficiency is top priority
```

### Template Variables

You can use placeholder patterns in your templates:

```markdown
## Dynamic Elements
- Current Season: [SEASON]
- Priority Mode: [WORK|VACATION|GUESTS]
- Complexity Level: [SIMPLE|STANDARD|ADVANCED]
```

## üìä Optimization Tips

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with minimal customization and add details as you learn what works.

### 2. Iterate Based on Results
After each AI session, note what worked well and what didn't, then adjust your context files.

### 3. Be Specific About Preferences
Instead of "I like automations," say "I prefer automations that have manual override options and send notifications when triggered."

### 4. Include Examples
In your personal info, include examples of automations you love or hate:
```markdown
## Automation Preferences
**Love**: Motion lights that dim gradually
**Hate**: Automations I can't easily disable
**Example of perfect automation**: [describe one]
```

### 5. Regular Updates
Update your context when:
- Your household changes (new members, schedules)
- You add significant HA devices
- Your automation goals evolve
- You discover new preferences

## üéØ Profile Templates for Common Use Cases

### Energy Saver Profile
Focus on efficiency and cost reduction:
- Aggressive away modes
- Detailed scheduling
- Usage monitoring preferences

### Security-First Profile
Emphasize safety and monitoring:
- Detailed notification preferences
- Multi-factor triggers
- Fail-safe priorities

### Convenience Profile
Optimize for ease of use:
- Simple, reliable automations
- Voice control integration
- Guest-friendly options

### Accessibility Profile
Support specific needs:
- Visual/audio alternatives
- Predictable behaviors
- Emergency shortcuts

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Be Honest About Technical Level**
   - Don't overstate your expertise
   - The AI adapts better with accurate information

2. **Include Constraints**
   - Budget limitations
   - Devices you can't change
   - Family member preferences

3. **Specify Naming Conventions**
   - How you like entities named
   - Preferred automation naming structure
   - Organization preferences

4. **Document Household Quirks**
   - Unusual schedules
   - Special requirements
   - Unique use cases

5. **Review Generated Content**
   - The interview creates a starting point
   - Add details it might have missed
   - Update as things change

## üîÑ Maintaining Your Profile

### Weekly
- Update any schedule changes
- Note new automation needs

### Monthly  
- Review and refine preferences
- Update device inventory if changed
- Adjust based on what's working

### Seasonally
- Update temperature preferences
- Adjust lighting needs
- Modify schedule for season

## üìù Example Customization Workflow

1. **Run the interview**: `python scripts/generate_interview.py`
2. **Review generated profile**: Open `context/4_personal_info.md`
3. **Enhance with specifics**: Add details the interview missed
4. **Copy templates**: `cp templates/*.md context/`
5. **Customize boot instructions**: Set your interaction preferences
6. **Define persona**: Choose or create an AI personality
7. **Test with real request**: Export and try an actual automation request
8. **Refine based on results**: Adjust what didn't work perfectly

Remember: The more specific and accurate your context, the better your AI automation assistance will be!
